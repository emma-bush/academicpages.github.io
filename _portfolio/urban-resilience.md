I live in central Scotland in the UK and spend most of my time in urban environments. I am passionate about climate adaptation in this context and engage in a number of community projects in my locality. 

I also practise back-garden permaculture to improve urban biodiversity, carbon sequestration and provide fresh food for my family and share thie technique with friends and neighbours. I am passionate about developing low-carbon transport and energy  options and reducing domestic energy use and making these choices accessible to everyone.
