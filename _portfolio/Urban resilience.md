I live in central Scotland in the UK and spend most of my time in urban environments. I am passionate about climate adaptation in this context and engage in a number of projects in my locality. I practise back-garden permaculture to improve urban biodiversity, carbon sequestration and provide fresh food for my family. I also prioritise low-carbon transport, low-carbon energy production and reductions in domestic energy production.
