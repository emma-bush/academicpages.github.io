[The African Phenology Network (APN)](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) brings together phenology researchers throughout the African continent and provides a metadata inventory of current and historic African phenology monitoring programs. The aims of the network are to facilitate communication and research collaboration between scientists, to promote standardised phenology field methods throughout the continent and to publicise results and publications featuring African phenology.

I founded the network in 2017 and we currently have metadata for 11 field sites across the Afro-tropics with many exciting plans in preparation.
