I am a researcher studying plants and their role in human society. 

My priority is to develop core and applied research that addresses the **climate and ecological emergency**. My main interests and expertise lie in **plant phenology**, **tropical ecosystems** and the role of plants in **urban resilience** and **climate adaptation**.

My current post at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is focussed on Urban Botany. I am at the beginning of a 2.5 year project to expore the ways in which plants influence the resilience of urban neighbourhoods. We will be designing this research through the lenses of the current COVID pandemic and the looming climate emergency.

In recent years I studied the impacts of climate change on tropical forest ecosystems in the central African rainforests (University of Stirling) and climate adaptation for agroforestry in the east African drylands (UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology). I continue to archive data from the longest continuous phenology recording program in Africa (Lopé National Park, Gabon) and have published a number of papers analysing these long-term weather and phenology data. In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.

In a personal capacity, I am keen gardener, a natural historian and a climate change activist. I practise low-input permaculture, low-carbon transport and retrofitting for domestic energy reduction.
