I am a Postdoctoral Researcher based in the UK, currently working at both the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)](https://www.ceh.ac.uk) and the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/256821).

My priority is to develop core and applied research that benefits resource-dependent communities and supports national and international governance plans as we face the ecological and climatological challenges of the next century.

I am fascinated by cyclical plant traits and the ways in which rapid climate changes impact tropical forest ecosystems. I have a particular passion for the Afro-tropics and dedicate as much time as I can to improving the knowledge base in this under studied region. My wider research interests are varied and I have a diverse publishing record ranging from socio-ecological survey of small-scale artisanal fisheries and a global review of the exotic pet trade to conservation theory and practise. 

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and continue to reach out to African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative. Get in touch if you have ideas and would like to be involved.
