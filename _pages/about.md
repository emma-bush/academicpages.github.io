Plants are amazing. There are more than XXX species of plant and fungi and a huge nMy research focusses on plants and their role in human society. 

I publish scientific papers that address the **climate and ecological emergency** and deliver policy-relevant briefings to governments. My main scientific interests and expertise lie in **plant life cycle events**, **tropical forest ecosystems**, **non-timber forest products** and the role of plants in **urban resilience** and **climate adaptation**.

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.
