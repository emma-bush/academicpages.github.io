I am a Postdoctoral Researcher based in the UK, currently working at both the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)](https://www.ceh.ac.uk) and the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/256821).

My priority is to develop core and applied research that **benefits human society** and supports **national and international governance** as we face the **ecological and climatological challenges** of the next century.

I am fascinated by **cyclical plant traits** and the ways in which **rapid climate changes impact tropical forest ecosystems**. I have a particular passion for the Afro-tropics and improving the knowledge of this under studied region. I have a diverse publishing record ranging from socio-ecological survey of small-scale artisanal fisheries and global reviews of the exotic pet trade to conservation theory and practise. 

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and continue to reach out to African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative. Get in touch if you have ideas and would like to be involved.

Personally, I am passionate about emissions reductions and climate adaptation and engage in low-input permaculture gardening, alternative green transport and domestic energy reductions.
