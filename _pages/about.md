Plants are incredible. There are ~350,000 plants species known to science with >1000 new species described every year. Plants create the foundations of our living planet and we rely on them for food, clothing, shelter, culture and medicines. 

There is still so much to be learnt from and about plants, but many plant species might be lost before we have the chance. [2 in 5 plants are threatened with extinction](https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/State%20of%20the%20Worlds%20Plants%20and%20Fungi%202020.pdf) due to human activities such as change of land use, over-harvesting and climate change.

My research focusses on plants, their role in human society and the **climate and biodiversity crises**. I publish scientific papers in internartional journals and provide policy-relevant briefings to governments. My main scientific expertise lie in **plant life cycle science (phenology)**, **tropical forest ecosystems**, **indigenous fruit trees** and the role of plants in **urban resilience** and **climate adaptation**.

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.
