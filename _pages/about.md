I am a Postdoctoral Researcher, based in the UK, currently working at both the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)](https://www.ceh.ac.uk) and the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/256821).

My priority is to develop core and applied research that benefits resource-dependent communities and supports national and international governance plans as we face the ecological and climatological challenges of the next century.

I am fascinated by cyclical plant traits and the ways in which rapid climate changes impact tropical forest ecosystems. I have a particular passion for the Afro-tropics and dedicate as much time as I can to improving the knowledge base in this under studied region. My wider research interests are varied and I have a diverse publishing record ranging from socio-ecological survey of small-scale artisanal fisheries and a global review of the exotic pet trade to conservation theory and practise. 

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and continue to reach out to African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative. Get in touch if you have ideas and would like to be involved.

### Net zero academic?

I am committed to working towards a net-zero academic career and this has to involve [flying less](https://academicflyingblog.wordpress.com).  Of course this can be really challenging with ongoing field work and collaborations on different continents. I recognise the huge importance in meeting face-to-face to develop equitable collaborations and the knowledge that can only come from observing a natural ecosystem in person. However I believe a lot of academic travel is redundant and can be replaced with carbon-light alternatives with a little careful thought. My guiding principle at the moment is to travel less and better, using overland travel wherever possible and making the most of social media and communications technologies to collaborate meaningfully with colleagues abroad.

If you are interested in reading more about this please take a look at the extensive documentation provided by the [FlyingLess Initiative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URRRh4zMSpvtZY08F9-Rkbx0qkNNmfzIzqOlqZWKxkE/edit).
