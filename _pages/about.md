I am a post-doc in the UK currently working at both the UK Centre for Hydrology and the University of Stirling.

I am fascinated by cyclical plant traits and the ways in which rapid climate changes impact tropical forest ecosystems. I have a particular passion for the Afro-tropics and dedicate as much time as I can to improving the knowledge base about these incredible landscapes.

I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) in 2017 and continue to reach out to African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this network. Get in touch if you have ideas and would like to be involved.

I am committed to pursuing a net-zero academic career and this involves [Flying Less](https://academicflyingblog.wordpress.com) although of course this can be really challenging with field work and collaborations on different continents. I recognise the huge importance in meeting face-to-face to develop equitable collaborations and the knowledge that can only come from observing a natural ecosystem in person. However I believe a lot of academic travel is redundant and can be replaced with less carbon-heavy alternatives with a little careful thought. If you are interested in reading more about this please take a look at the extensive documentation provided by the [FlyingLess Initiative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URRRh4zMSpvtZY08F9-Rkbx0qkNNmfzIzqOlqZWKxkE/edit).
