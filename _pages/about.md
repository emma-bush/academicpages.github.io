I am a researcher at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh where I study plants and their role in human society. 

I have a diverse publishing record but my priority is to develop core and applied research that addresses the **climate and ecological emergency**. My main interests and expertise lie in **plant phenology**, **tropical ecosystems** and the role of plants in **urban resilience** and **climate adaptation**.

In my current role I am focussed on urban botany and the ways in which plants improve the resilience of urban neighbourhoods in the face of climate change and other shocks (such as global pandemics!).

In recent years I studied the impacts of climate change on tropical forest ecosystems in central African rainforests and climate adaptation for improved agroforestry in east African drylands. I have published a number of papers analysing the longest continuous phenology recording program in Africa (from Lopé National Park, Gabon). In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.

In a personal capacity, I am keen gardener, a natural historian and an activist for emissions reductions. I practise low-input permaculture, alternative green transport and domestic energy reduction.
