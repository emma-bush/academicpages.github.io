**I am a research scientist studying plants, their role in human society and the climate and biodiversity crises**. 

I publish scientific papers in international journals and provide policy-relevant briefings to governments. My core scientific expertise lies in plant life cycle science (phenology), tropical forest ecosystems, climate impacts on plants and the role of plants in urban resilience and climate adaptation.

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.
