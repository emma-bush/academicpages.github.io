**Plants are incredible**. There are ~350,000 plant species with >1000 species new to science described every year. Plants create the foundations of our living planet and we rely on them for food, clothing, shelter, culture and medicines. 

There is still so much to be learnt from and about plants, but many of them might be lost before we have the chance. [2 in 5 plants are threatened with extinction](https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/State%20of%20the%20Worlds%20Plants%20and%20Fungi%202020.pdf) due to human activities such as change of land use, over-harvesting and climate change.

**My research focusses on plants, their role in human society and the climate and biodiversity crises**. I publish scientific papers in international journals and provide policy-relevant briefings to governments. My core scientific expertise lies in plant life cycle science (phenology), tropical forest ecosystems, climate impacts on plants and the role of plants in urban resilience and climate adaptation.

In 2017 I founded the [African Phenology Network](https://africanphenologynetwork.online) and am keen to hear from African scientists and those interested in African phenology to lead on this initiative.
